# üß† Synapse ‚Äì Electron Focus Broadcaster
A lightweight **Electron-based focus state manager** that syncs your focus mode across devices using Firebase. Designed to work with the full **Synapse ecosystem** (Mobile App + Chrome Extension), this app ensures real-time sync of your working state to block distractions on phones and browsers.

---

## ‚úÖ Features
- Syncs focusMode status to Firebase Realtime Database.
- Auto-resets focusMode to OFF on app load and exit for safety.
- Visual status indicators for current focus state (ON/OFF).
- Graceful error handling with console logging.
- Shows formatted user ID in UI (XXXX-XXXX).
- Works seamlessly with Flutter mobile app and Chrome extension for unified focus control.
- Secure preload architecture with contextBridge, blocking direct Node.js access in the renderer.

- Automatically kills blacklisted apps (e.g., Spotify) when focus mode is triggered.
- Unique user ID auto-generated and saved locally.
- Periodically polls Firebase to reflect real-time changes in UI.
