# üß† Synapse ‚Äì Electron Focus Broadcaster
A lightweight Electron-based focus state manager that syncs your focus mode across devices using Firebase.
Designed to work with the full Synapse ecosystem (Mobile App + Chrome Extension), this app enforces distraction-free workflows across desktop, browser, and mobile, all in real-time.

---

## ‚úÖ Features
- Two-way sync with Firebase (Realtime DB): Seamlessly updates and reads focusMode.
- FocusMode Auto-reset: Automatically resets to OFF on app start and safe exit.
- Live Focus Indicator: Visual ON/OFF indicator updates every second.
- Secure Preload Architecture:
    - Uses contextBridge and ipcRenderer.invoke channels only.
    - Completely isolates Node.js logic from renderer.
- Background Process Monitoring:
    - Detects whitelisted productivity apps.
    - Instantly kills blacklisted distraction apps when focus is triggered.
- Popup Interruption Alert:
    - Custom modal (popup.html) triggered when user tries to open a blacklisted app.
    - Asks user for intent before continuing.
- Auto-generated User ID:
    - 8-character secure ID saved in data/user_id.txt.
    - Displayed as XXXX-XXXX in UI.
- Optimized IPC Channels:
    - getFocusMode, setFocusMode, resetFocusMode, and getUsername.
- State-aware Polling Loop:
    - Every 1.5s, checks system processes to determine active mode.

    - Prevents redundant writes to Firebase.

- Supports Popup + Main UI:
    - Independent windows for main dashboard and interruption modal.
- Failsafe Error Logging:
    - Gracefully handles all fetch, file system, and process-killing errors.
- Fullscreen, distraction-free experience:
    - Intended for immersive workflows.
    - Can run silently in background on startup.

## üõ° Security Highlights (New)
- contextIsolation: true and nodeIntegration: false enforced.
- Only whitelisted APIs are exposed via preload.js.
- Firebase credentials remain local via .env file (never hardcoded).
- App logic centralized in main.js, keeping preload.js minimal.
